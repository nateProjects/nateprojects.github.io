We had hundreds of submissions again this year, and although I couldn't respond to them all, in a few cases I'd wanted to get in touch because even if the work didn't quite make the final shortlist, it was close. I really liked the idea of The Diary, drawing on a known Doctor Who object but spinning out a wonderfully human story. We had a lot of stories taking a new person's perspective on the Doctor's life and they were very rarely done as well as this. Best wishes and do keep on writing!"</p><figure class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/500yeardiary.jpg" alt="500yeardiary" width="430" height="541" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/500yeardiary-xs.jpg 300w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/500yeardiary-sm.jpg 480w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/500yeardiary-md.jpg 768w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/500yeardiary-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 23, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/bootyful-demake/" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Bootyful Demake "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">Bootyful Demake</span> </a><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/contact/" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Contact "><span class="btn__text">Contact</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
