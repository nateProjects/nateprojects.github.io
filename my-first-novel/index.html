This story was originally called “Downline”, which describes the structure of the community the book is about, but I discovered that there was already a book called that. I can’t remember where I first heard the phrase “Cotton Covered World”, and I can’t find a specific origin for it, but I’ve seen it in numerous places since to describe when someone insulates themselves from the real world, and that seemed a perfection summary of the book to me.</p><p>By the summer of 2014 I’d planned to write this novel in the late autumn as part of the <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/participants/nclivegerard/novels/cotton-covered-world/stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NaNoWriMo</a> (National Novel Writing Month) competition. It would give me a deadline and a daily expectation of my progress. So in just under 3 weeks (writing an hour or two a day) I wrote over 50,000 words. I later added another 40,000 words.</p><figure class="wp-image-46 aligncenter"><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/30508970-cotton-covered-world/parts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/cotton_book_cover_small.png" alt="Cotton Covered World" width="400" height="621" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/cotton_book_cover_small-xs.png 300w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/cotton_book_cover_small-sm.png 480w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/cotton_book_cover_small-md.png 768w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/cotton_book_cover_small-lg.png 1024w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/cotton_book_cover_small-xl.png 1360w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/cotton_book_cover_small-2xl.png 1600w"></a></figure><p></p><p>UPDATE:</p><p>The first three chapters of my novel are available to read online:</p><p><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/95184524-cotton-covered-world-chapter-1-brendon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cotton Covered World, Part 1</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 23, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/authors/nate/" rel="author">Nate</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/kulhwch/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Kulhwch</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/i-butterfly/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> I, Butterfly </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
