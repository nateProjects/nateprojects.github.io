This story looks really ambitious; ... Really promising work!"</blockquote><blockquote>"I enjoyed the game more because of the audio. ... would love to see you take that aspect further, ... You might not be a voice actor, but the audio gave it a real War of the Worlds feel, and I thought you did a pretty darn good job. ... Good work on the technical end and the recordings - bravo there."</blockquote><blockquote>"Amazing concept!"</blockquote><blockquote>"I love the general idea this presents of mashing up two classical works, and even the specific idea this presents of mashing up other works with "The War of the Worlds". I also really like both the voiceover option and the ability to turn it off; ... in summary I'd enjoy seeing this continue."</blockquote><p>And from <a href="https://emshort.blog/2018/09/29/introcomp-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Short</a>, the venerable interactive fiction writer herself:</p><blockquote>"In contrast with some read-aloud IF, it feels as though this game was created for this kind of presentation; the sentences are meant for reading. The reader performs them with gusto, too. ... it was definitely on the more compelling end among audio IF stories Iâ€™ve experienced.<p></p><p>... I was enjoying the rest of the presentation enough that I kind of wished I could sit back and just listen."</p></blockquote></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 23, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/authors/nate/" rel="author">Nate</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/portfolio/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Portfolio</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/finished-and-unfinished-projects/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Finished &amp; Unfinished Projects </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
