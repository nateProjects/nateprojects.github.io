This story was originally called “Downline”, which describes the structure of the community the book is about, but I discovered that there was already a book called that. I can’t remember where I first heard the phrase “Cotton Covered World”, and I can’t find a specific origin for it, but I’ve seen it in numerous places since to describe when someone insulates themselves from the real world, and that seemed a perfection summary of the book to me.</p><p>By the summer of 2014 I’d planned to write this novel in the late autumn as part of the <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/participants/nclivegerard/novels/cotton-covered-world/stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NaNoWriMo</a> (National Novel Writing Month) competition. It would give me a deadline and a daily expectation of my progress. So in just under 3 weeks (writing an hour or two a day) I wrote over 50,000 words. I later added another 40,000 words.</p><figure class="wp-image-46 aligncenter"><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/30508970-cotton-covered-world/parts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/cotton_book_cover_small.png" alt="Cotton Covered World" width="400" height="621" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/cotton_book_cover_small-xs.png 300w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/cotton_book_cover_small-sm.png 480w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/cotton_book_cover_small-md.png 768w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/cotton_book_cover_small-lg.png 1024w"></a></figure><p></p><p>UPDATE:</p><p>The first three chapters of my novel are available to read online:</p><p><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/95184524-cotton-covered-world-chapter-1-brendon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cotton Covered World, Part 1</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 23, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/kulhwch/" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Kulhwch "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">Kulhwch</span> </a><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/i-butterfly/" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  I, Butterfly "><span class="btn__text">I, Butterfly</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
