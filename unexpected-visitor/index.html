This story looks really ambitious; ... Really promising work!"</blockquote><blockquote>"I enjoyed the game more because of the audio. ... would love to see you take that aspect further, ... You might not be a voice actor, but the audio gave it a real War of the Worlds feel, and I thought you did a pretty darn good job. ... Good work on the technical end and the recordings - bravo there."</blockquote><blockquote>"Amazing concept!"</blockquote><blockquote>"I love the general idea this presents of mashing up two classical works, and even the specific idea this presents of mashing up other works with "The War of the Worlds". I also really like both the voiceover option and the ability to turn it off; ... in summary I'd enjoy seeing this continue."</blockquote><p>And from <a href="https://emshort.blog/2018/09/29/introcomp-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Short</a>, the venerable interactive fiction writer herself:</p><blockquote>"In contrast with some read-aloud IF, it feels as though this game was created for this kind of presentation; the sentences are meant for reading. The reader performs them with gusto, too. ... it was definitely on the more compelling end among audio IF stories I’ve experienced.<p></p><p>... I was enjoying the rest of the presentation enough that I kind of wished I could sit back and just listen."</p></blockquote></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 23, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/portfolio/" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Portfolio "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">Portfolio</span> </a><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/finished-and-unfinished-projects/" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Finished &amp; Unfinished Projects "><span class="btn__text">Finished &amp; Unfinished Projects</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
