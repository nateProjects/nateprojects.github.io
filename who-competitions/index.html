We had hundreds of submissions again this year, and although I couldn't respond to them all, in a few cases I'd wanted to get in touch because even if the work didn't quite make the final shortlist, it was close. I really liked the idea of The Diary, drawing on a known Doctor Who object but spinning out a wonderfully human story. We had a lot of stories taking a new person's perspective on the Doctor's life and they were very rarely done as well as this. Best wishes and do keep on writing!"</p><figure class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/500yeardiary.jpg" alt="500yeardiary" width="430" height="541" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/500yeardiary-xs.jpg 300w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/500yeardiary-sm.jpg 480w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/500yeardiary-md.jpg 768w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/500yeardiary-lg.jpg 1024w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/500yeardiary-xl.jpg 1360w, https://nateprojects.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/500yeardiary-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 23, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/tags/uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/authors/nate/" rel="author">Nate</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/bootyful-demake/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Bootyful Demake</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://nateprojects.github.io/contact/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Contact </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://nateprojects.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
